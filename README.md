# Operating System Concepts

This repository contains resources, examples, and explanations of core **Operating System (OS)** concepts. It is designed to help you understand the fundamental principles that drive modern operating systems. The materials include theoretical concepts, practical examples, and implementation details.

## Contents

- **Process Management**: Concepts related to process creation, scheduling, synchronization, and communication.
- **Memory Management**: Techniques such as paging, segmentation, virtual memory, and memory allocation algorithms.
- **File Systems**: Understanding file structures, file management, and disk organization.
- **Input/Output Systems**: I/O devices, buffering, scheduling, and device drivers.
- **Concurrency and Synchronization**: Concepts of multi-threading, mutexes, semaphores, and race conditions.
- **Deadlocks**: Detection, prevention, and recovery techniques related to deadlocks.
- **Security and Protection**: OS-level security mechanisms, authentication, and access control.
